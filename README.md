# UI-ASSIGNMENT-FOR-SDET

🧪 UI Automation Assignment – SDET (Frontend)

📌 Overview

This assignment is designed to assess your problem-solving skills, test automation expertise, and object-oriented design abilities. The goal is to create a robust UI automation framework for the website Midtrans Demo, implementing automated end-to-end test flows for credit card transactions.

⸻

🎯 Objectives

You are required to:
	•	Build a UI automation framework from scratch (Web or Mobile).
	•	Implement tests using Selenium/Appium with your choice of language stack (Java/Python/JS/TS).
	•	Deliver clean, maintainable, and modular code.
	•	Showcase test reporting and cross-browser compatibility.

✅ Requirements

Must-Have Scenarios
	1.	Successful Payment Flow:
Automate end-to-end checkout for purchasing a “Pillow” using Credit Card with a successful payment result.
	2.	Failed Payment Flow:
Automate end-to-end checkout for purchasing a “Pillow” using Credit Card with a failed payment result.
	3.	Reporting:
Integrate a reporting framework of your choice to display test execution results.
	4.	Cross-Browser Testing:
Ensure tests run on Chrome and Firefox.

🔑 Test Data

Payment Type	Card Number	Expiry Date	CVV	Bank OTP
Success Credit Card	4811 1111 1111 1114	02/20	123	112233

🛠 Tech Stack Recommendations
	•	Automation Tool: Selenium / Appium
	•	Framework: TestNG / JUnit / Cucumber (Java) or PyTest / Playwright (Python/JS)
	•	Build Tool: Maven / Gradle (Java) or equivalent
	•	Reporting: Allure / Extent Reports or similar

⸻

📂 Submission Guidelines
	1.	Project Folder:
	•	Name the folder with your name.
	•	Include:
	•	Source code and test scripts
	•	Framework files
	•	Test reports
	•	README.md with instructions and assumptions
	2.	Version Control:
	•	Maintain a local Git repository with frequent, clear commits showing solution evolution.
	•	Share the final project as a zipped folder or via a Google Drive link (ensure public access).

⸻

⚠️ Rules of the Game
	•	You have 2 full days to complete the task.
	•	Do NOT publish the solution on public GitHub/GitLab repositories or forums.
	•	Code must be original—plagiarism may lead to rejection.
	•	Avoid excessive use of Thread.sleep(); use proper waits instead.
	•	Write meaningful assertions to validate test results.
	•	Use intuitive class and function names with comments explaining the WHY, not the WHAT/HOW.

⸻

💡 Bonus Tips
	•	Keep tests atomic and fast.
	•	Follow clean coding practices for maintainability.
	•	Use design patterns like Page Object Model (POM) where appropriate.
	•	Remember Martin Fowler’s advice:
“Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.”

⸻

✅ Deliverables Checklist
	•	End-to-end test for successful payment
	•	End-to-end test for failed payment
	•	Reporting framework implemented
	•	Cross-browser execution validated
	•	Proper folder structure and documentation
	•	Zipped project folder with README.md included

⸻

Would you like me to prepare a sample folder structure (tree format) for this assignment (with recommended files and naming conventions) that you can directly use to start coding?
